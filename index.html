            <p> It was a dark and stormy night ...</p>    
            <p> when my foot walked away from my body </p>
            <p> it traisped into the closet, rustling through the clutter.</p>
            <p> Suddenly, my toes stretched and wrapped themselves around my favorite pair of shoes. </p>
            <p> To an ordinary person, these shoes are just plain ordinary. Black leather boots with a wide berth for my toes,
             a high arch for my flat feet, and conforming shin-high sheath. My foot loves these shoes. Now why did it want them
             on this night? Why did it disembody itself for <em>those</em> shoes?</p>
